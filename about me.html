<h1>About me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is <b>Ketan Swami</b>, and I am an aspiring developer with a keen interest in technology and problem-solving. Currently, I am pursuing a <b>Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) at Mangalmay Institute of Management and Technology</b>, where I am honing my skills in programming, design, and the core concepts of computer science.
<br /><br />
    My primary focus is on front-end development, and I am passionate about creating websites and applications that combine functionality with aesthetic design. From crafting responsive layouts to implementing interactive elements, I thrive on building user-centric experiences.
    <br /><br />
    In addition to my academic background, I have hands-on experience with front-end tools and frameworks. I constantly challenge myself to stay updated with industry trends, learning new technologies and refining my craft. Whether it’s coding, designing, or collaborating with others on projects, I bring enthusiasm and attention to detail to every task.
    
    When I’m not coding, I enjoy exploring new tech innovations, delving into creative projects, and finding inspiration to fuel my personal and professional growth. I am eager to collaborate on exciting projects and contribute to impactful solutions.
